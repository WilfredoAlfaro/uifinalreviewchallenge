## ðŸ§± Project Structure & Best Practices

This project follows **Playwright** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** and includes:

- âœ… **Page Object Model (POM)** structure for scalable test management
- âœ… A properly designed **Base Class** (or base test file) to share common setup across tests
- âœ… Use of **`locator`** API (preferred in Playwright for stable selectors)
- âœ… Strategic use of **XPath** selectors when necessary (e.g., dynamic or sibling-based elements)
- âœ… **Valid `expect()` assertions** at the **test level** to ensure user flows and state transitions are correctly validated

> ðŸ’¡ Use `npx playwright test` to run the full test suite.
